# product-preview-card

I have created a product preview card using HTML and CSS. There were few issues that i have encountered here. The first issue was all the contents to the right side of the image was overflowing out of the actual dimensions of the card itself. To adresss this i have used box-sizing property in CSS and set it to border-box to fit all the content inside the card. The second issue was the displaying of two different images when it's viewed on larger or smaller screen sizes. One workaround for this was to keep the image container (**left-side class in this case) empty. There should be no img tag inside it. Now for displaying the images i have targeted this tag with background-image in CSS and selected the desktop image file from the image folder as its URL. Additionally i have provided background-size property and have set it to :cover; value. This will fully show the image by taking the full area of the image container. Now i have set a media query with max side of 600px and did the same thing for the image but provided the mobile image file instead of the desktop one.
